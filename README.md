👋 Hi, I’m **Julián Ruiz Rodríguez** and I'm currently based in Puerto Rico 🇵🇷

👀 I’m interested in Web development technologies and design.

🌱 I’m currently learning **React** as well as **the MERN stack** & **Cloud development** on Udemy & Coursera.

🤳🏼 I'm also working with [SpotlightStudio](https://www.spotlightstudiopr.com/) as their freelance Web designer/developer!
